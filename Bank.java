//Assignment Q4
/*
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savings
account and other as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and
withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque 
book facility but no interest. Current account holders also maintain a minimum balance 
and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.  Create a class
account that stores customer name, account number (Should generate automatically if new 
customer added) and type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct 
to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions in 
order to achieve the following tasks: a. Accept deposit from a customer and update the 
balance b. Display the balance. c. Compute and deposit interest. d. Permit withdrawal and
update the balance. e. Check for minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary and update the 
balance.
